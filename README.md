# landing-page

This is a landing page, created for an assignment from [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

The task is to create a landing page for a website, using a [reference](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) for the styling. The idea is to use the HTML and CSS that we have learnt so far. 

I created this landing page for an Exercise Physiology service as this was my previous career.
